## Introduction  
SKILL programming language is based on artificial intelligence laanguage Lisp. SKILL lets us quickly and easily customize existing CAD applications and helps us develop new applications. This document describes basics of SKILL and its applications.

## SKILL Programming Notations
- Notation by other languages: `fun( arg1 arg2 .....)`
- Notation by Lisp language  : `(fun arg1 arg2 .....)`

## Cadence SKILL language at a glance
SKILL is command language of cadence environment. Whenever we use menus, bindkyes etc. the cadence software triggers SKILL functions to complete the tasks. Other SKILL functions compute or retrieve data from designs. We can enter SKILL functions directly on a command line insted of gui mode.
